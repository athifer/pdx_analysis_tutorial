# Volcano Plot Implementation Summary

## What We Added

### 1. Volcano Plot Functionality
- Added `volcano_plot()` function to `advanced_workflows.py`
- Performs differential expression analysis using t-tests
- Calculates fold changes between treatment and control groups
- Creates publication-quality volcano plots with significance thresholds

### 2. Realistic Gene Dataset
- Updated from 1,000 to **20,000 genes** (matching typical RNA-seq studies)
- Implemented realistic differential expression profiles:
  - ~10% of genes are differentially expressed (2,000 target genes)
  - 60% upregulated / 40% downregulated split in responders
  - Realistic fold change distributions (log2FC: 0.5-4.0)

### 3. Biological Realism
- Gene categories include:
  - Oncogenes (10%)
  - Tumor suppressors (5%)
  - Immune response genes (15%)
  - Drug targets (8%)
  - Housekeeping genes (62%)
- Treatment effects modeled based on gene biology
- Variance scaled appropriately for each gene type

## Results

### Differential Expression Summary
- **Total genes analyzed**: 20,000
- **Significantly upregulated**: 198 genes
- **Significantly downregulated**: 145 genes
- **Not significant**: 19,657 genes
- **Overall DE rate**: ~1.7% (realistic for treatment comparison)

### Significance Thresholds
- **Fold change**: |log2FC| > 1.0 (2-fold change)
- **Statistical significance**: p-value < 0.05
- **Multiple testing**: Considered in interpretation

## Usage

Run volcano plot analysis:
```bash
python src/python/advanced_workflows.py
```

Or run individual volcano plot:
```python
from advanced_workflows import volcano_plot
volcano_plot(expression_data, metadata_file="data/metadata.csv")
```

## Files Generated
- `results/volcano_plot.png` - High-resolution volcano plot (300 DPI)
- Automatic significance annotation for top differentially expressed genes
- Color-coded points (red=up, blue=down, gray=not significant)

This implementation now provides a realistic PDX analysis workflow that matches the scale and statistical patterns of real RNA-seq studies.
