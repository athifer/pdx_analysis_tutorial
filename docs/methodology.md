# PDX Analysis Methodology

## Overview of Patient-Derived Xenografts (PDX)

Patient-Derived Xenografts (PDX) are cancer models created by implanting patient tumor tissue directly into immunocompromised mice. These models preserve the original tumor's characteristics better than cell lines, making them valuable for:

- **Drug efficacy testing**: Evaluating new treatments before clinical trials
- **Biomarker discovery**: Identifying predictive markers of response
- **Resistance mechanisms**: Understanding how tumors evade therapy
- **Personalized medicine**: Testing treatments for individual patients

## Experimental Design Considerations

### Model Selection
- **Tumor heterogeneity**: Use multiple PDX models per cancer type
- **Passage number**: Early passages (P2-P5) maintain original characteristics
- **Growth characteristics**: Consider doubling time and engraftment success

### Treatment Protocol
- **Sample size**: Minimum 8-10 mice per group for statistical power
- **Randomization**: Random assignment to treatment arms
- **Blinding**: Investigators blinded to treatment assignments
- **Endpoint criteria**: Pre-defined criteria for study termination

### Data Collection
- **Frequency**: Tumor measurements twice weekly minimum
- **Consistency**: Same investigator, same time of day
- **Quality control**: Regular caliper calibration, measurement training

## Data Analysis Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing
```
Raw Data → Quality Control → Normalization → Analysis-Ready Data
```

**Quality Control Steps**:
- Remove outlier measurements (>3 SD from mean)
- Check for systematic measurement errors
- Validate growth curve patterns

### 2. Statistical Analysis Plan
```
Primary Analysis: Treatment effect on tumor growth
Secondary Analysis: Biomarker associations
Exploratory Analysis: Multi-omics integration
```

### 3. Interpretation Framework

**Clinical Relevance Criteria**:
- **Significant effect**: p < 0.05 with adequate power
- **Meaningful effect size**: >30% growth inhibition
- **Reproducibility**: Consistent across multiple models

**Biomarker Validation**:
- **Discovery phase**: Screen all available biomarkers
- **Validation phase**: Test top candidates in independent cohort
- **Clinical translation**: Validate in human samples

## Best Practices

### Statistical Considerations
- **Power analysis**: Calculate required sample sizes before study start
- **Multiple comparisons**: Adjust for multiple testing
- **Effect sizes**: Report confidence intervals, not just p-values
- **Model assumptions**: Validate assumptions of statistical tests

### Reproducibility
- **Protocol standardization**: Detailed SOPs for all procedures
- **Data versioning**: Track all data processing steps
- **Code documentation**: Comment all analysis scripts
- **Result validation**: Independent confirmation of key findings

### Reporting Standards
- **ARRIVE guidelines**: Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments
- **Transparent reporting**: Include all data, methods, and code
- **Statistical reporting**: Follow statistical reporting guidelines
